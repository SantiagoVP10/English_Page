           			<h1 class="titulos" style="font-size: 31px;">Greenhouse Effect.</h1>
           				<p>The phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect in terms of gases, the components of the planetary atmosphere, the part of the energy that is in the ground. It affects all planetary bodies endowed with atmosphere. According to the majority of the scientific community, the greenhouse effect is accentuated on Earth by the emission of certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, due to human activity.<br>

						This phenomenon prevents the solar energy always receive by the earth return through space, producing a global scale in an effect similar to that observed in a greenhouse.</p><br>

           				<p>Annual energy balance of the Earth developed by Trenberth, Fasullo and Kiehl of the NCAR in 2008. It is based on data from the period of March 2000 to May 2004 and is an update of his work published in 1997. The surface of the Earth receives from the Sun 161 w / m2 and the Greenhouse Effect of the Atmosphere 333w / m², in total 494 w / m2, as the surface of the Earth emits a total of 493 w / m2 (17 + 80 + 396), supposes an absorption net of heat of 0.9 w / m2, which at the present time is causing the warming of the Earth.</p>

            			<p>The Earth, like any hot body above absolute zero, emits thermal radiation, but because its temperature is much lower than solar, it emits infrared radiation because it is a black body. The radiation emitted depends on the temperature of the body. In the study of the NCAR have concluded an average annual oscillation between 15.9 ° C in July and 12.2 ° C in January compensating the two hemispheres, which are in different seasons and the terrestrial part that is day with which it is at night. This oscillation of temperature supposes an annual average radiation emitted by the Earth of 396 W / m2. <br><br>

 						The infrared energy emitted by the Earth is trapped for the most part in the atmosphere and forwarded back to Earth. This phenomenon is called Greenhouse Effect and guarantees the temperate temperatures of the planet. <br><br>

						The greenhouse effect is a natural atmospheric phenomenon that allows maintaining a pleasant temperature on the planet, by retaining part of the energy that comes from the sun. Through human activities large amounts of carbon are released into the atmosphere at a rate greater than that which producers and the ocean can absorb, these activities have disturbed the global carbon budget, slowly but continuously increasing CO2 in the atmosphere; propitiating changes in the climate with consequences in the rise in sea level, changes in rainfall, disappearance of forests, extinction of organisms and problems for agriculture. <br><br>

						Gases such as CO2, surface ozone (O3) 4, nitrous oxide (N2O) and chlorofluoralkanes accumulate in the atmosphere as a result of human activities, leading to an increase in global warming, this occurs because the accumulated gases slow the loss of radiation infrared (heat) from the atmosphere to space. A part of the heat is transferred to the oceans, increasing the temperature of the oceans, which implies an increase in the global temperature of the planet. Because CO2 and other gases capture solar radiation in a way similar to glass in a greenhouse, global warming produced in this way is known as the greenhouse effect</p>

            			<p>Gases integral to the atmosphere, of natural and anthropogenic origin, that absorb and emit radiation in certain wavelengths of the infrared radiation spectrum emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and ozone (O3) are the main greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. There is also a series of totally man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as halocarbons and other substances containing chlorine and bromide, which are covered by the Montreal Protocol. In addition to CO2, N2O, and CH4, the Kiyoto Protocol addresses other greenhouse gases, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).<br><br>
						
						GHG molecules have the ability to absorb and re-emit long-wave radiation (this is the infrared radiation, which is eminently thermal) that come from the sun and the one that reflects the surface of the Earth into space, controlling the flow of natural energy through the climate system. The climate must in some way adjust to the increases in GHG concentrations, which generates an increase in infrared radiation that is absorbed by GHGs in the lower layer of the atmosphere (the troposphere), in order to maintain the energy balance Of the same. This adjustment will generate a climate change that will manifest itself in an increase in global temperature (referred to as global warming) that will generate an increase in sea level, changes in precipitation regimes and in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events ( such as storms, hurricanes, El Niño and La Niña phenomena), and a variety of impacts</p>
